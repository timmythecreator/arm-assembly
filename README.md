# ARM Assembly Learning Project

This repository is my personal project to **track progress in learning ARM assembly**.  
It contains small code snippets, notes, and experiments that mark milestones of my study journey.

---

## üìÇ Project Contents
- `infinite_loop.s` - a simple infinite loop example in ARM assembly.

---

## ‚öôÔ∏è Requirements

### On Intel (x86/x86_64 host)
Install cross-compilation tools and QEMU user emulation:
```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt install build-essential gcc-arm-linux-gnueabihf qemu-user gdb-multiarch
```

### On ARM (native host, e.g. Raspberry Pi)

Only the standard build tools are required:
```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt install build-essential
```

---

## ‚ñ∂Ô∏è How to Build & Run
### On Intel (cross-compilation + QEMU)
```bash
arm-linux-gnueabihf-gcc -o infinite_loop infinite_loop.s -nostdlib -static
qemu-arm ./infinite_loop
```

### On ARM (native execution)
```bash
as -o infinite_loop.o infinite_loop.s
ld -o infinite_loop infinite_loop.o
./infinite_loop
```

---

## üêû Debugging Workflow (Intel host)

### You can debug ARM binaries with QEMU and GDB:

1) Start QEMU with gdbserver:
```bash
qemu-arm -g 4242 ./infinite_loop
```

2) In another terminal, connect with GDB:
```bash
gdb-multiarch
(gdb) file ./infinite_loop
(gdb) target remote localhost:4242
```

**Useful GDB commands:**
* `lay next` ‚Üí view code with source/assembly (TUI mode)
* `ni` ‚Üí next instruction
* `si` ‚Üí step into instruction

## üìù Notes

_This repository is for educational purposes only._
_Examples are intentionally minimalistic to illustrate basic ARM assembly concepts._
_Expect frequent updates with new snippets, comments, and milestones._
